# Setup

## Requirements
python3.9 
...


## Installation
Installing the simulation engine is very simple, as it only involves cloning the relevant github project:

    git clone https://github.com/Blockchain-Technology-Lab/Cardano-Pooling-Simulator.git

## Execution
To run the simulation, navigate to the directory of the project and run the main script:
    
    cd Cardano-Pooling-Simulator
    python3.9 main.py

It is also possible to run the simulation with different parameters (e.g. number of agents). For a full list of options
refer to the [Configuration](configuration.md) page. In [Examples](examples.md), we also provide some examples to 
showcase the different capacities of the simulation engine.
