# PoS-Pooling-Games-Simulation
Tool to simulate staking behaviour in Proof-of-Stake Blockchains.

Run file main.py (python main.py) to execute the simulation with predefined values and generate figures from the results.
Alternatively, run interactive-viz/runViz.py (python -m interactiveViz.runViz) for an interactive execution of the simulation in the browser.
To execute multiple simulations at once, run batch-run.py (python batch-run.py).

Python 3.9+ required
